From the land beyond beyond
From the land past hope and fear
FRom the interstices of galactic overflows
Chimes never heard fizzle out of black holes
Black holes that let nothing out, suck all in
But only the heavenly harmonics know the way out
Hang head down, wings simmering in the wind
They quickly dove into the dockets, in and out
Queens laid the egg from above
Drones spent their time singing balanced diet songs
The honey monger, fish monger, and upper kilns

And so goes the music of life
